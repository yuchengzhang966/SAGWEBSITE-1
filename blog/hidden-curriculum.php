                    <p>In both academia and the professional world, success is determined by more than just grades, technical skills, or job performance. There's a "hidden curriculum" of unspoken rules, social norms, and strategic insights that often separates high-achievers from the rest. Understanding and mastering this hidden curriculum is a critical component of long-term success.</p>
