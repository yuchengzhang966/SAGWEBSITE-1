                                    <p><strong>Why this misconception persists:</strong> Elementary education emphasizes thorough reading of relatively short texts, and early literacy requires careful attention to individual words.</p>
                                    <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Expert readers are highly selective, adjusting their approach based on purpose and text structure.

                                    <p><strong>The core problem:</strong> Students who read every word with equal attention waste cognitive resources on low-value content, experience unnecessary fatigue, and often miss the broader conceptual structure that provides meaning to individual details.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Evidence-based advanced reading approaches focus on expanding perceptual span, reducing subvocalization for appropriate content, and strategic processing—which can double or triple reading speed while maintaining or improving comprehension of key information.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Cognitive science research consistently shows that passive techniques like highlighting and re-reading are among the least effective for long-term retention and understanding.
