                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Use Spaced Repetition</h3>
                    <p>Review words at gradually increasing intervals. Start with daily review of new words, then space out to every few days, then weekly. Our digital system automatically schedules reviews for optimal retention.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Create Word Associations</h3>
                    <p>Connect new words to images, stories, or familiar concepts. The more vivid or unusual the association, the more memorable the word becomes. Our flashcards include suggested associations for challenging words.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Learn in Context</h3>
                    <p>Words are easier to remember when learned in meaningful sentences. Read example sentences aloud and create your own sentences using new vocabulary to reinforce understanding and usage.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Group Related Words</h3>
                    <p>Study words with similar meanings, opposite meanings, or from the same root together. Our system groups words by themes and relationships to strengthen your semantic network.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Break Down Word Parts</h3>
                    <p>Learn common roots, prefixes, and suffixes to decode unfamiliar words. For example, knowing that "mal-" means "bad" helps with words like malevolent, malicious, and malfunction.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Use Active Recall</h3>
                    <p>Instead of passively reviewing words, test yourself regularly. Actively retrieving information from memory strengthens recall ability, which is exactly what you'll need on test day.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How many words should I learn per day?</h3>
                <p>We recommend learning 10-15 new words per day, while also reviewing previously learned words. This pace is challenging but manageable for most students.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How far in advance should I start studying vocabulary?</h3>
                <p>Ideally, begin 3-4 months before your test date. Vocabulary acquisition takes time, and distributed practice over a longer period is more effective than cramming.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need both the digital and physical versions?</h3>
                <p>No, either version will provide complete coverage. The physical cards are great for tactile learners, while the digital version offers the advantage of automated spaced repetition.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are these words specific to the SAT or ACT?</h3>
                <p>Our system covers high-frequency words for both tests. While there are some differences between SAT and ACT vocabulary, the core high-value words substantially overlap.</p>
