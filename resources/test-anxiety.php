            <div class="content-section">
                <p>Test anxiety affects up to 40% of students and can significantly impact performance. It manifests through physical symptoms (racing heart, nausea), cognitive effects (mind blanks, difficulty concentrating), and emotional responses (fear, dread, panic). Our toolkit offers research-backed approaches to recognize and manage these symptoms.</p>

                    <p>A quick sensory awareness exercise that helps break anxiety spirals by identifying 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.</p>

                <h3>Will these techniques work for severe test anxiety?</h3>
                <p>Our toolkit has helped students with mild to moderate test anxiety. For severe anxiety that significantly impacts daily functioning, we recommend using these techniques alongside professional support.</p>
